# Changelog

All notable changes to flowproof are recorded here. Versions follow the
workspace version (Rust crates, the Python wheel, and the npm package move
together).

## 0.5.0

### Added

- **Security controls: deterministic security regression.** Assert that a
  security control still holds on every replay, with recorded evidence.
  - `assert_no_secret_leak: ${VAR}` certifies a named secret never appears in a
    run's observable output: the agent model-boundary trajectory, a web flow's
    surface text captured at each step boundary, or an `assert_api` response
    body. Scanned identically at record and replay; only the variable NAME
    travels, never the value; a leak at record fails the run and mints no trace
    (a store-guard for the trace's own cassette). A flow kind with no readable
    corpus fails as a capability error, never a vacuous pass.
  - `control:` block names a flow's security control with a stable id, so a
    suite becomes a control-coverage map over time; per-suite id uniqueness is
    enforced at load.
  - Access-control regression as a composed pattern: perform the attempt as a
    declared identity, assert the denial (a 403, a UI block), and prove the
    identity was alive in the same run so a dead credential cannot read as a
    passing control.
  - Shared `identities:` in a suite (`session: <name>`), declared once and
    dereferenced into each flow at load so the trace stays self-contained.
- **`flowproof audit`.** Renders a control-coverage map (YAML or `--json`) from
  a persisted run record (`.flowproof/runs/<id>/report.json`) that
  `flowproof run` writes, with no re-replay. `--since <run-id>` diffs two runs
  and reports added, removed, and verdict-changed controls, exiting non-zero on
  a regression (a removed control, or one that turned failing).

See [docs/authoring.md](docs/authoring.md#security-controls) and
[examples/access-control/](examples/access-control/).

## 0.4.1

### Fixed

- egress containment deadlocked every command-agent flow on Linux (the
  notify-fd handoff used a syscall the filter traps); containment is now opt-in
  (only flows using allow_egress/assert_no_egress) and the handoff no longer
  deadlocks.

## 0.4.0 (2026-07-24)

### Added

- **Agent-boundary testing (`app: agent`).** Deterministic record/replay of an
  agent's model-call trajectory against a mocked model boundary. OpenAI-style
  and Anthropic Messages backends, streaming synthesized symmetrically at record
  and replay, and http-target agents (`agent.url` + `proxy_port`) alongside
  `command:` agents. Assertions: `assert_tool_call` / `assert_no_tool_call` with
  `where` matchers, and reply-content checks. See
  [docs/agent-testing.md](docs/agent-testing.md).
- **MCP tool-boundary testing.** The agent's Model Context Protocol traffic is
  recorded and replayed as additive trace lanes: stdio servers, streamable-HTTP
  servers, and server notifications over the GET SSE stream. A mocked tool result
  is answered locally and never forwarded.
- **`flowproof capture`.** A byte-fidelity HTTP capture endpoint for inspecting
  exactly what a tool under test sends. See [docs/capture.md](docs/capture.md).
- **Web grammar additions.** Attribute assertions (`attribute X is Y`),
  computed-style assertions over a closed property allowlist, a `Scroll` action,
  and scoped-container targets (`the "X" in the item containing "Y"`).
- **Egress containment for `app: agent` (Linux).** A `command:` agent flow
  can now declare the network it is allowed to reach and certify that it
  reached nothing else:
  - `agent.allow_egress`: a list of allowed destinations (`host:port`,
    `ip:port`, `cidr:port`, or a bare `host`/`ip` for any port). `${VAR}`
    references resolve at execution and are stored unresolved. Loopback is
    exempt wholesale, so the model proxy and local MCP servers need not be
    listed.
  - `assert_no_egress`: a step that certifies the set of undeclared
    destinations the agent attempted is empty. It is a capability claim - on
    any platform or driver where containment is not enforced it fails
    ("cannot certify") rather than passing vacuously.
  - On Linux, enforcement is a real, unprivileged, default-deny seccomp
    user-notification filter with a parent supervisor, live in both record
    and replay so the phases share a denial environment. The supervisor
    performs allowed connections itself over a `pidfd_getfd` dup of the
    child's socket and never uses `SECCOMP_USER_NOTIF_FLAG_CONTINUE` for
    address-bearing syscalls, closing the check-then-reuse race.
  - Every agent run prints its containment tier (enforced / not contained,
    with the reason) on every platform. macOS, Windows, `url:` services, and
    kernels older than 5.6 are reported "not contained".
  - The trace gains an additive egress audit lane (containment tier, the
    unresolved allow-list, and any denied attempts). A flow that does not use
    the feature serializes byte-identical to before.

See [docs/agent-testing.md](docs/agent-testing.md) for the grammar, the
per-platform honesty table, and the v1 limitations.

### Fixed

- **Test stability.** The agent-boundary end-to-end tests each mutated the
  process-global `FLOWPROOF_AGENT_UPSTREAM`; under parallel `cargo test` that
  raced and could flake or hang CI. They are now serialized so a run is
  deterministic.
- **npm publish pipeline.** The multi-platform publish workflow is idempotent
  and fails open, so a partially-published release can be re-run safely.
